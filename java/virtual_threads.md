# Virtual Threads
Virtual threads, introduced in JDK 21, are a significant advancement in Java's concurrency model, offering a more efficient and scalable way to handle concurrent tasks, especially when dealing with I/O operations.

## What are Virtual Threads?
1. Lightweight Threads: Virtual threads are much lighter than traditional platform or kernel threads. They are designed to be created in large numbers, potentially millions, without the significant resource overhead associated with platform threads.
2. Efficiency in Blocking Operations: They excel in scenarios involving blocking I/O operations. Unlike platform threads, which become inefficient when blocked, virtual threads can efficiently handle blocking without wasting CPU resources.
3. Asynchronous Programming Solutions: Virtual threads address limitations in asynchronous programming by allowing a more straightforward, imperative style of coding, even for I/O-intensive operations. This contrasts with the complexity of writing and maintaining asynchronous code using callbacks and future objects.

## Key Features and Benefits
1. Less Resource-Intensive: Virtual threads consume significantly fewer resources compared to platform threads. They need less memory and are faster to create and destroy.
2. Scalability: Because of their lightweight nature, you can spawn a large number of virtual threads to handle concurrent tasks, making applications more scalable.
3. Simplified Programming Model: They allow developers to write simpler, more readable code. Complex asynchronous operations can be written in a sequential, blocking style without the performance penalties typically associated with blocking platform threads.
4. Daemon Threads: Virtual threads are always daemon threads, which means they don't prevent the JVM from exiting.

## Under the Hood
1. Continuation Mechanism: Virtual threads use a continuation mechanism to save and restore their state. When a virtual thread performs a blocking operation, it unmounts from the platform thread and saves its state to the heap. This frees up the platform thread to perform other tasks.
2. ForkJoin Pool: They typically run on a modified ForkJoin pool, with the number of platform threads generally correlating with the number of CPU cores.

## Limitations and Considerations
1. Performance Overhead: While they are cheaper to block, running compute-intensive tasks on virtual threads can be less efficient than using platform threads.
2. Pinning to Platform Threads: If a virtual thread executes native code or synchronization blocks, it gets pinned to a platform thread, which could potentially negate some benefits of virtual threads in certain scenarios.
3. Framework Integration: Many existing Java frameworks are adapting to or already support virtual threads, which means developers might not directly interact with them but will benefit from their integration into these frameworks.
In summary, virtual threads in JDK 21 represent a paradigm shift in Java concurrency, offering a more efficient and programmer-friendly way to handle concurrent tasks, especially in I/O-bound operations. They bridge the gap between the ease of traditional thread-based programming and the efficiency demands of modern, scalable applications.
